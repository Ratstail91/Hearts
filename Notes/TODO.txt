*	Try to keep the project as stable as possible.
*	Use a separate development branch where necessary
*	Don't forget to search for "TODO" tags in the code

*	Remove NamedManager as soon as possible

*	Remove unnecessary KAGE modules
>	Rearrange the project hierarchy
*	Breakdown and analyse the structure
*	Upgrade to the current Codebase where possible

>	Remedy Card's graphical system
>	Use the current Image class in Card & Deck
*	Add in graphical buttons and onscreen text for user friendlyness

*	Research SDL_mixer, to fully understand the audio system

*	Rename HeartsEngine to GameManager

*	Try to unify the swapping/highlighted cards system.
		This system seems to be split between the three player classes
		I could use a unified highlighting system for both swapping and playing a card
