# Project Hearts version 1.1, 6th September 2013

## Introduction

I've added a few features that I wanted, mostly to show off that I can complete a set task. Hopefully the program will be sufficient proof, as long as job interviewers don't look at the code.

## Instructions

Drop the "rsc" folder into the same directory as the executable  
To select a card, click on it  
To pass three cards at the start of the round, select them and press the pass button  
Try to keep your score as low as possible by avoiding the hearts cards, and the queen of spades
